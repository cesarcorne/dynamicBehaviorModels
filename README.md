The models used in the article 'A Study of the Electrum and DynAlloy Dynamic Behavior Notations' by César Cornejo, Germán Regis, Nazareno Aguirre, and Marcelo Frias, published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, are available in this repository.

For a detailed replication of the study, I recommend visiting the website: https://sites.google.com/view/dynalloyelectrumevaluation. There, you will find the models with 30 runs for statistical purposes and more detailed information.

Note: If you have Alloy 6 and wish to use the Electrum (.ele) models, you should either change the extension to .als or copy the model from this repository.
